# Exercises 3


## Problem 1

Complete the [case study on stocks and bonds](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/cases/bvnorm/bvnorm.md) from class, and write a short report describing your methods and conclusions.


## Problem 2

Complete the [case study on green buildings from class.](https://github.com/jgscott/ECO394D/blob/master/exercises/green_buildings.md)  


## Problem 3

Download the data in `creatinine.csv` from the course website.  Each row is a patient in a doctor's office.  The variables are:  
- age: patient's age in years.  
- creatclear: patient's creatine clearance rate in mL/minute, a measure of kidney health (higher is better).  

Use this data, together with your knowledge of linear regression, to answer three questions:    
  1. What creatinine clearance rate should we expect, on average, for a 55-year-old?  
  2. How does creatinine clearance rate change with age?   (This should be a number with units ml/minute per year.)  
  3. Whose creatinine clearance rate is healthier (higher) for their age: a 40-year-old with a rate of 135, or a 60-year-old with a rate of 112?  


## Problem 4

Complete the [case study on milk prices from class.](https://github.com/jgscott/learnR/blob/master/cases/milk/milk.md)    Write a short report summarizing your approach and conclusions.  Make sure your report includes an explicit equation that expresses the optimal price of milk as a function of the wholesale cost c and the price-elasticity of demand, beta.
